* status
** created hprolog.lisp as working/production version
** working on stack overflow (test2) then (test4) under LWW
   Stack overflow (stack size 15998).
    1 (continue) Extend stack by 50%.
    2 (abort) Return to top loop level 0.
*** back6 and prove6 need to be mutually tail recursive
   
** ignoring stack overflow - it goes away if speed=3, debug=0
** :lisp rule added to hprolog
* usage
** (ql:quickload :cl-holm-prolog)
** (in-package :hprolog)
** (cl-user::ltest)
* todo
** rewrite prove6 + back6 for use in looping languages
* branches
** pt-20191220 - adding T/NIL return from :lisp
