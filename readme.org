* status
** created hprolog.lisp as working/production version
** working on stack overflow (test2) then (test4) under LWW
   Stack overflow (stack size 15998).
    1 (continue) Extend stack by 50%.
    2 (abort) Return to top loop level 0.
*** back6 and prove6 need to be mutually tail recursive
   
** ignoring stack overflow - it goes away if speed=3, debug=0
** branch pt-20191218-breakout - installing a :lisp rule which can modify everything before continuing

** branch pt-20191219-segfault fails in LWM and sbcl
** branch pt-20191219b-segfault fails in LWM but gives TYPE-ERROR in sbcle
** branch pt-20191219b new working branch 

* usage
** (ql:quickload :cl-holm-prolog)
** (in-package :hprolog)
** (test2)
** (test4)

* todo
** rewrite prove6 + back6 for use in looping languages
